# PistonBoltPrinter
A fabric mod that automatically builds piston bolts for you!
# How to use
1. Place a slime block and right click it with an empty hand, this will create the starting position. 
2. Place a honey block and right click it with an empty hand, this will set the direction, the piston bolt's direction will be slime block --> honey block, it can go straight or diagonal.
3. Walk in the direction you set and it will start building.
# Other info
Right clicking at nothing with an empty hand will toggle the mod ON/OFF.<br> 
Currently the mod requires carpet extra's "accurateblockplacement" as it needs to place piston reversed. However, the mod can lazy-place pistons if you go back after. If you use lazy-place on diagonals, you will need to go twice as there are 2 direction of pistons on that one.<br> 
Due to your ping, the server might not allow you to use your fast block placement. The mod currently places blocks at a speed of 120 blocks per second at its maximum.<br>
